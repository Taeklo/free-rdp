 * `pin` variable = The number pin used to access your RDP, make it something you will remember.

# Starting the RDP
 * When all your variables are filled in click the play button and wait for around 2-3minutes for it to finish. 
 * Once you get the "Finished Succesfully" message you can open https://remotedesktop.google.com and connect to your new RDP using the pin you chose.
 
And that's it, the RDP comes pre-installed with google chrome , google remotedesktop and a desktop environment.
